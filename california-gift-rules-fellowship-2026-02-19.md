# California Gift Rules: Governor's Innovation Fellowship

**Prepared:** February 19, 2026
**Subject:** Legality of a $300 pooled gift from fellowship members to a state employee instructor
**Applicable Period:** Calendar Years 2025-2026

---

## Executive Summary

The Governor's Innovation Fellowship cohort proposes to pool **personal funds totaling $300** to purchase a gift for their instructor, who is a **California state employee** with decision-making authority over the fellows. Under the [Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC)](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/) rules governing gifts to public officials and employees, **this gift is permissible** under current dollar limits. However, because the instructor evaluates or makes decisions that affect the fellows, additional **conflict-of-interest considerations** apply and should be documented.

## 1. Applicable Law and Regulations

California's gift rules for state employees are governed by:

| Authority | Citation | What It Covers |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Political Reform Act** | [Gov. Code §§ 89500-89506](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&division=&title=9.&part=&chapter=9.5.&article=4.6.) | Gift limits, reporting, disqualification |
| **FPPC Regulation 18940** | 2 CCR § 18940 et seq. | Definitions — what constitutes a "gift" |
| **FPPC Regulation 18944** | 2 CCR § 18944 | Group gifts from multiple contributors |
| **FPPC Regulation 18945** | 2 CCR § 18945 | How to determine the "source" of a gift |
| **FPPC Regulation 18945.2** | 2 CCR § 18945.2 | Group gift source attribution |
| **FPPC Regulation 18703** | 2 CCR § 18703 | Disqualification due to gifts |
| **Form 700** | [Statement of Economic Interests](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/public-officials-and-employees-rules-/conflict-of-interest-codes/form-700-statement-of-economic-interests.html) | Annual disclosure form for reportable gifts |

## 2. Gift Limit Analysis

### Current Gift Limit: $630 (2025-2026)

The [FPPC adjusts the gift limit every two years](https://www.insidepoliticallaw.com/2025/02/05/california-adopts-new-contribution-gift-limits-for-2025-2026/) based on the Consumer Price Index:

| Period | Gift Limit (per source, per year) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| 2021-2022 | $520 |
| 2023-2024 | $590 |
| **2025-2026** | **$630** |

### This Scenario

| Factor | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total gift value | $300 | Under $630 limit |
| Source of funds | Personal funds from fellows | Not state/program money |
| Recipient | State employee (instructor) | Subject to FPPC gift rules |
| Lobbyist involvement | None | Standard $630 limit applies (not the $10 lobbyist limit) |

**Result:** The $300 gift is **well within** the annual gift limit, even if the entire amount were attributed to a single source (which it is not — see Section 3).

---

## 3. Group Gift Rules — How "Source" Is Determined

This is the most commonly misunderstood aspect of California's gift rules.

### The Misinterpretation

> "We pooled $300 as a group, so the instructor received a $300 gift from the fellowship."

**This is incorrect.** California law does not treat a pooled gift as coming from "the group."

### The Actual Rule (Reg. 18944 / 18945.2)

When multiple individuals pool personal funds to purchase a single gift:

- **Each contributor is a separate "source"**
- The gift limit ($630) applies **independently to each contributor**
- The total pooled amount is irrelevant to the gift limit calculation

### Applied to This Scenario

| If the cohort has... | Each person contributes... | Per-source gift amount | Status |
|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| 10 fellows | $30 each | $30 | Well under $630 |
| 15 fellows | $20 each | $20 | Well under $630 |
| 20 fellows | $15 each | $15 | Well under $630 |
| 6 fellows | $50 each | $50 | Under $630, but triggers reporting (see Section 4) |

In every realistic scenario for a fellowship cohort, each individual contribution is far below the $630 limit.

---

## 4. Reporting Requirements

### The $50 Reporting Threshold

Under Reg. 18944, a group gift **does not need to be reported** on the instructor's Form 700 unless **any single contributor gave $50 or more.** If someone did contribute $50+, only that individual's portion becomes reportable — not the entire $300.

### Reporting Summary for This Gift

| Individual Contribution | Reportable on Form 700? | Action Required |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Under $50 | **No** | None |
| $50 or more | **Yes** — that contributor only | Instructor discloses on Schedule D of Form 700 |

### The $630 Disqualification Threshold

If any single contributor's gifts to the instructor totaled $630+ in the calendar year (combining this gift with any other gifts), the instructor would be **disqualified from making decisions** that affect that contributor. At $300 total split among multiple people, this threshold is not remotely at risk.

---

## 5. Conflict of Interest Considerations

### Why This Matters Here

The instructor **makes decisions that affect the fellows** (evaluations, program outcomes, recommendations, etc.). While the gift is legal under FPPC dollar limits, this relationship introduces a **conflict-of-interest dimension** that goes beyond simple gift math.

### The Relevant Standard

Under [Gov. Code § 87100](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=87100.&lawCode=GOV), a public official must not make, participate in, or influence a governmental decision in which they have a financial interest. Gifts can create the appearance of influence even when below legal thresholds.

### Practical Concerns

| Concern | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Instructor grades/evaluates fellows who gave the gift | **Moderate** | Time the gift after evaluations are complete |
| Gift could appear to influence instructor's decisions | **Low-Moderate** | Document that all fellows contributed equally |
| Perception by non-contributing fellows or outside observers | **Low** | Ensure participation is voluntary, not pressured |
| Future decisions by instructor benefiting gift-givers | **Low** | Gift is modest and from the entire cohort |

### Key Distinction: Legal ≠ Advisable Without Precautions

The gift does not violate FPPC gift limits. But an instructor who receives a gift from people they evaluate should be able to demonstrate that the gift did not influence their official actions. The recommendations in Section 6 address this.

---

## 6. Risk Mitigation Recommendations

Even though the gift is legally permissible, the following steps protect everyone involved:

### Before the Gift

1. **Confirm the funding source is personal** — do not use any state funds, fellowship program budgets, or government-issued payment methods
2. **Make participation voluntary** — no fellow should feel pressured to contribute
3. **Keep a contribution log** — a simple list of who contributed and how much, in case the instructor's ethics office or filing officer asks

### Timing

4. **Present the gift after final evaluations** — if the instructor grades, evaluates, or makes recommendations about the fellows, wait until those decisions are finalized before giving the gift. This eliminates even the appearance of influence

### Documentation

5. **Notify the instructor's supervisor or ethics officer** — a quick heads-up is not legally required but demonstrates good faith and protects the instructor
6. **Retain the contribution log for the calendar year** — the instructor may need it if they file Form 700 and need to determine whether any single source exceeded $50

### What NOT to Do

- Do **not** use fellowship program funds or state resources
- Do **not** ask the instructor what they want if it could be perceived as solicitation
- Do **not** give cash — a tangible gift or gift card is cleaner for documentation purposes
- Do **not** exceed $50 per person if you want to keep the gift completely off the reporting radar

---

## 7. Common Misinterpretations

### Myth 1: "The $630 limit applies to the total pooled amount"

**Wrong.** The limit applies per source (per contributor). A $300 pooled gift from 10 people is ten $30 gifts, not one $300 gift.

### Myth 2: "State employees can't accept any gifts"

**Wrong.** State employees can accept gifts up to $630 per source per year. They just must report gifts of $50+ from a single source on Form 700.

### Myth 3: "Group gifts are always reportable"

**Wrong.** Under Reg. 18944, a group gift is not reportable unless at least one contributor gave $50 or more. If everyone gave under $50, the instructor has no reporting obligation.

### Myth 4: "The old limit was $500"

**Outdated.** The limit has increased multiple times with CPI adjustments. For 2025-2026, it is **$630**. People often remember older limits ($520, $590) and assume they still apply.

### Myth 5: "If the gift is legal, there's no conflict of interest concern"

**Partially wrong.** Gift limits and conflict-of-interest rules are separate frameworks. A gift can be under the dollar limit and still create an appearance problem if the recipient makes decisions affecting the giver. This is why timing and documentation matter (see Section 6).

## Conclusion

The proposed $300 pooled gift from personal funds is **legally permissible** under California's Political Reform Act and FPPC regulations. The total is under the $630 annual limit, and when properly attributed to individual contributors, each person's share is minimal. The primary precaution — given the instructor's evaluative role over the fellows — is to **time the gift after evaluations are complete** and maintain a simple contribution log for transparency.
