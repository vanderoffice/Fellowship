## 1. Purpose

The Governor's Innovation Fellows Program was established under **[Executive Order N-30-25](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EO-N-30-25-Innovation.pdf)** to modernize California state government operations through internal talent. This charter defines how Cohort 1 Senior Fellows organize, coordinate, and deliver on that mandate.

> The Senior Fellows operate as a cross-agency network — **21 practitioners** embedded across **15 departments** and **9 agencies** who use their positions to drive measurable modernization outcomes. This charter is the single source of truth for how we work together.

## 2. Goals

| | Goal | Description |
|:-:|------|-------------|
| **I** | **Deliver on the Executive Order** | EO N-30-25 directs the state to improve efficiency, service delivery, and customer experience through innovation. Senior Fellows are the execution layer. Every project, report-back, and coordination effort should trace to this mandate. |
| **II** | **Coordinate Across Agencies** | Fellows are distributed across 9 agencies and 15 departments. Monthly and quarterly meetings create a shared operating picture — surfacing common challenges, sharing solutions, and avoiding duplicated effort. |
| **III** | **Build Momentum for Modernization** | The fellowship provides strength in numbers: when agencies see peers at similar departments succeeding with modernization, the barrier to adoption drops. Fellows actively share wins across agency boundaries. |
| **IV** | **Demonstrate Impact for Continuity** | The current administration ends in January 2027. The fellowship's continued existence depends on a clear record of results. Fellows document outcomes, build visible artifacts, and produce materials that make the case for the program's value to any incoming administration. |

## 5. Operating Principles

| # | Principle | Description |
|:-:|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Outcomes matter most** | Track what changed — and what was attempted. Both inform what comes next. |
| 2 | **Share early and often** | A solution that stays in one department is a missed opportunity. |
| 3 | **Document everything** | If it's not written down, it didn't happen — and it won't survive a transition. |
| 4 | **Respect the chain** | Fellows work within their departments' authority. The network provides support, not directives. |
| 5 | **Make it visible** | Wins that aren't communicated don't build momentum. Report-backs, briefs, and artifacts are first-class deliverables. |

---

## 6. Deliverables

The fellowship produces recurring artifacts that serve both internal coordination and external communication.

| Artifact | Frequency | Audience |
|----------|:---------:|----------|
| Monthly meeting notes | Monthly | Fellows, ODI |
| ODI report-back deck | Quarterly | ODI leadership |
| Agency assessment summaries | As completed | Fellows, agency sponsors |
| Project briefs (one-pagers) | As needed | Fellows, ODI, agency leadership |
| Implementation roadmaps | Per engagement | Agency partners |
| **Fellowship impact report** | **End of 2026** | **ODI, Governor's Office, incoming administration** |

---

## 7. Decision-Making

| Scope | Who Decides | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Operational** | Consensus among fellows | Meeting agendas, coordination logistics, artifact formats |
| **Strategic** | Consultation with program leadership | Program goals, ODI relationship, external communications |
| **Department-Level** | Each fellow's home department | The fellowship does not override agency authority |

---

## 8. Communication

| Channel | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Primary channel** | TBD — to be decided at first meeting |
| **Document repository** | [GitHub — vanderoffice/Fellowship](https://github.com/vanderoffice/Fellowship) |
| **Presentations & decks** | [Fellowship Operations site](https://vanderoffice.github.io/presentations/) |

---

## 9. Amendments

This charter is a **living document**. Proposed changes are discussed at monthly meetings and adopted by consensus. Major changes (scope, membership, governance) require program leadership review.
