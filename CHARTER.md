# Governor's Innovation Fellows — Senior Fellows Charter

**Version:** Draft 0.1
**Effective:** February 2026
**Applies to:** Cohort 1 Senior Fellows

---

## Purpose

The Governor's Innovation Fellows Program was established under **Executive Order N-30-25** to modernize California state government operations through internal talent. This charter defines how Cohort 1 Senior Fellows organize, coordinate, and deliver on that mandate.

The Senior Fellows operate as a cross-agency network — 21 practitioners embedded across 15 departments who use their positions to drive measurable modernization outcomes. This charter is the single source of truth for how we work together.

---

## Goals

### 1. Deliver on the Executive Order

EO N-30-25 directs the state to improve efficiency, service delivery, and customer experience through innovation. Senior Fellows are the execution layer. Every project, report-back, and coordination effort should trace to this mandate.

### 2. Coordinate Across Agencies

Fellows are distributed across 9 agencies and 15 departments. Monthly and quarterly meetings create a shared operating picture — surfacing common challenges, sharing solutions, and avoiding duplicated effort.

### 3. Build Momentum for Modernization

Some departments are further along than others. The fellowship provides strength in numbers: when reluctant agencies see peers at similar departments succeeding with modernization, the barrier to adoption drops. Fellows actively share wins across agency boundaries.

### 4. Demonstrate Impact for Continuity

The current administration ends in January 2027. The fellowship's continued existence depends on a clear record of results. Fellows document outcomes, build visible artifacts, and produce materials that make the case for the program's value to any incoming administration.

### 2026 Schedule

| Date | Format | Type |
|------|--------|------|
| **Feb 20** | Virtual | Monthly |
| **Mar 20** | Virtual | Monthly |
| **Apr 17** | In-Person | Quarterly Review |

### Meeting Formats

**Monthly Virtual (1 hr 30 min recommended)**
- Round-robin updates by agency cluster (5 min each)
- Cross-cutting topic or challenge (20 min)
- Coordination items and blockers (15 min)
- Action items and next steps (10 min)

**Quarterly In-Person (full 2 hrs)**
- Deliverable showcase: each fellow presents one outcome (2 min each, ~45 min)
- Strategic alignment: how current work maps to EO N-30-25 goals
- ODI report-back preparation: what goes in the next briefing
- Retrospective: what's working, what's not, what to adjust

## Operating Principles

1. **Outcomes over activity.** Track what changed, not what was attempted.
2. **Share early and often.** A solution that stays in one department is a missed opportunity.
3. **Document everything.** If it's not written down, it didn't happen — and it won't survive a transition.
4. **Respect the chain.** Fellows work within their departments' authority. The network provides support, not directives.
5. **Make it visible.** Wins that aren't communicated don't build momentum. Report-backs, briefs, and artifacts are first-class deliverables.

---

## Deliverables

The fellowship produces recurring artifacts that serve both internal coordination and external communication:

| Artifact | Frequency | Audience |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Monthly meeting notes | Monthly | Fellows, ODI |
| ODI report-back deck | Quarterly | ODI leadership |
| Agency assessment summaries | As completed | Fellows, agency sponsors |
| Project briefs (one-pagers) | As needed | Fellows, ODI, agency leadership |
| Implementation roadmaps | Per engagement | Agency partners |
| Cohort 1 impact report | End of 2026 | ODI, Governor's Office, incoming administration |

---

## Decision-Making

- **Operational decisions** (meeting agendas, coordination logistics, artifact formats) are made by consensus among fellows.
- **Strategic direction** (program goals, ODI relationship, external communications) is set in consultation with program leadership.
- **Department-level decisions** remain with each fellow's home department. The fellowship does not override agency authority.

## Communication

- **Primary channel:** [TBD — Slack, Teams, or email distribution list]
- **Document repository:** [GitHub — vanderoffice/Fellowship](https://github.com/vanderoffice/Fellowship)
- **Presentations & decks:** [Fellowship Operations site](https://vanderoffice.github.io/presentations/)

## Amendments

This charter is a living document. Proposed changes are discussed at monthly meetings and adopted by consensus. Major changes (scope, membership, governance) require program leadership review.

*Draft prepared February 2026. This document will evolve as the Senior Fellows establish their working patterns and priorities.*
