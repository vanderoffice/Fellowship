## Overview

The Governor's Innovation Fellows Program launched in 2025 as a cornerstone of Governor Gavin Newsom's government modernization initiative. Unlike traditional leadership development programs, this initiative functions as a **delivery engine**—developing leaders while producing measurable improvements in government efficiency and service delivery.

> *"Fellows are selected not by seniority, but for their initiative, creativity, problem-solving mindset, and customer focus."*
