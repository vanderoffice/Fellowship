## Key Insights

### Why This Program Is Different

1. **Delivery Engine, Not Just Development:** 80% of time goes to measurable project work, not just training
2. **Internal Talent Recognition:** Many fellows had already delivered significant innovations before selection
3. **Merit Over Seniority:** Selection based on initiative, creativity, and problem-solving—not tenure
4. **Cross-Agency Visibility:** Innovations can be diffused across government
5. **Overlapping Cohorts:** 4-month cycle creates continuous institutional knowledge transfer
